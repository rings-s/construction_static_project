The project has some complicated objections around car parking and traffic management. As a club we had no experience or knowledge with regards to this and needed a consultant to work with. I approached Kevin and from the outset it felt like he understood our needs, talked us through the process, created a high quality piece of work and met all deadlines asked of him. We are grateful for all of the work and support given to us and wouldn't hesitate to recommend Transport Consulting for this kind of work.",
